# Product List

## Welcome

Thanks for checking out this coding challenge.

## The Challenge

You have to build a product list application.
You don't have to build a backend for this application;
you can use the [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com) to get the products and categories.

You can use any framework or library you want.

## Requirements

You can implement some of the features; depending on your experience and time, you can choose which features to implement.

- [x] Get products
- [x] Get categories
- [x] Display products by category
- [x] Pagination for products, 5 products per page (did pagination on client side, since API definition does not allow for pagination)
- [ ] Sort products by id or price with ascending and descending
